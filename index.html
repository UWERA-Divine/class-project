<b>Jeremy Bentham</b><p>
<I>The philosopher and jurist Jeremy (1748-1832) were born at Houndsditch, London, on 15th February 1748.</I> He proved to be something of a child prodigy: while still a toddler he was discovered sitting at his father’s desk reading a multi-volume history of England, and he began to study Latin at the age of three. At twelve, he was sent to Queen’s college oxford, his father, a prosperous attorney, having decided that <h1>Jeremy would follow him into the law, and feeling quite that his brilliant son would one day be Lord chancellor of England.</h1><p>
<h2>Bentham, however, soon became disillusioned with the law,</h2> especially after hearing the lecture of leading authority of the day, sir William Blackstone (1723-80). Instead of practicing the law, he decided to write about it, and he spent his life critiquing the existing law and suggesting ways for its improvement. <h6>His father’s death in 1792 left him financially independent and for nearly forty</h6>  years he lived quietly in west mister,<U> producing between ten and twenty sheets of manuscript a day,</U> <em>even when he was in his eighties.</em>
